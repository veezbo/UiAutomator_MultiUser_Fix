Fixes the problem UiAutomator has with multiple users in the Android Open Source Project.

Support for changing the necessary file in the SDK's is included, but it is uncertain whether it is even possible to rebuild the SDK with modifications (as is necessary).

INSTRUCTIONS:
	1. Place the script in your AOSP directory.
	2. Install Python if you don't have it, and install the pyparsing library as well (recommended: using pip).
	3. Run the script, and follow the prompts.
	4. Rebuild AOSP (I've provided build scripts in my Android_Scripts repo, which you can use as you desire)
	5. Now, uiautomator should have multi-user support on both devices and emulators built or flashed from AOSP.

WORD OF CAUTION:
	Please be aware that this is not an official solution. Furthermore, this is a workaround that directly modifies internal AOSP code. It is highly recommended (and you will be given a prompt to do so) that you backup the file that is modified, so that you can replace it after you've finished using UiAutomator.
